### Technologies used
- **HTML:** The skeleton of the site. Will provide basics of text, images, input fields, links, navigation, and overall structure.
- **CSS:** Will be used to provide the color, background, sizing, spacing, animations, and complete look and feel of the application.
- **JavaScript:** A huge part of the application, providing calculation of earnings, interactivity when using buttons in the store, and turning the "website" into a "game."
- **React:** Used for login, dynamic store, and connecting the user to the leaderboard data, which will be updated live.
- **Service:** Backend services I will use include:
  - Login
  - Leaderboard
  - Random Fact
- **Authentication:** Users will need to log in in order to play and save their progress, along with having their name appear on the leaderboard.
- **Database Data:** User information and progress will be stored persistently in a database. Leaderboard will be able to show top players. Login will be required to play.
- **Websockets:** Users will be able to see the live leaderboard of the richest players. Data will be coming back and forth from server and client through websockets.
## HTML Deliverable
- **HTML Pages:** I made four different HTML pages for login in, playing, viewing the leaderboard, and viewing achievements.
- **HTML Elements:** I was sure to use all the needed HTML elements including BODY, NAV, MAIN, HEADER, and FOOTER.
- **Links:** I used links to connect the pages of the application together and provide a link to my GitHub repository.
- **Text:** I used text in my application to show the names of store items, descriptions, and prices. I also used text in other places of the application to let the user know where they are and where they can navigate next.
- **Placeholders:** My application includes placeholders for the random fun facts that I will be referring to later in the development process.
- **Images:** I used some very standard images for the items I currently have in my store. These are placeholders for now as I would like to do my own art for the game in the future.
- **Login:** My application contains a basic login form for users to use right as they land on the webpage. This will be fully functional in the future. There is also a spot on the play page where the username of the current user is displayed.
- **Database:** The leaderboard page will be referring to the database so placeholders have been set up to show what the leaderboard will look like in the future.
- **Websockets:** The leaderboard page will also be using websockets to make the data available to all players and update live as more money is gained by users.
